# Chrometrol Panel Plus
It's like powertoys but for chromium-based browsers! It is generated from a Chrome Extension Typescript Starter.

# Where did you get the logo(s)
It was generated by a cool art maker from ![hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai/s/art-maker/8-GiCwoWxsNDsK3Zs). I meant to be make pixel art but it got greyed out. 

# Where did you get the icons
[HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/). 

# Why is the file called dist.crx
1. Was in a rush and didn't bother to rename
2. dist.crx is the default name meaning distribution. 

# What can it do now. 
## Tab Controller
* Display a list of your tabs with their titles
* Shift+Click to duplicate tab
* Control+Click to focus tab
* Normal click scrolls down to control tab's audio sources
## Parellelized Searching
* Type search into your omnibox followed by a space and then whatever you want. You'll then get like 10ish tabs using different search engines. 

# What do you plan to do with this in the future
Some fun stuff with `natural` and other nlp npm packages, perhaps make the browser smart about what you type into the omnibox. For example "please take me to my last stack overflow tab".
